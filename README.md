# Immo Eliza AI project
## Description
The purpose of the project is to create AI models that will be able to estimate value of real estate properties in Belgium. 

The project consisted of two parts:

 First part was group project where we created data scraper to acquire 10k unique properties dataset from nonspecified Belgian real estate website. 

 Second part was done alone. Main focus was on cleaning and preprocessing the dataset which was later used to train/test serveral different AI models. 

## Installation
Use python package manager pip to install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage
Run propertiesScrape.py to acquire the dataset. 
Run main.py to evaluate how the different AI models behave on the dataset. Results are printed in terminal.
